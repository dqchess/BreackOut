This asset contains two separate games: a horizontal and vertical jumper. 
Each games data is independent from the other games so it easy to remove one game from your project or to test both in the same project.

To test each game:

- Add the the scenes to the build settings, located in InfiniteJumper/Horizontal/Scenes and InfiniteJumper/Vertical/Scenes.
- Run the MainMenu scene for the game you would like to test.

To remove a specific game from your project:

- Delete games folder i.e. InfiniteJumper/Horizontal or InfiniteJumper/Vertical
- Delete the corresponding games level data i.e. InfiniteJumper/Resources/Horizontal_Levels or InfiniteJumper/Resources/Vertical_Levels
- Add remaining game specific scenes to build settings i.e. InfiniteJumper/Horizontal/Scenes or InfiniteJumper/Vertical/Scenes

Finally run the Main Menu scene for the corresponding game (located in the Scenes folder).
